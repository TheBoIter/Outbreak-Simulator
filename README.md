# Outbreak-Simulator
Personal project done using Processing (i.e. p5.js)

Written in 2020 as a personal project in practicing use of Processing.
To run, simply import it into any Processing compiler. Set height and width both to 600.
Note: This is a very bad simulation - as mentioned, it is more of a proof of learning than anything. But hopefully it is somewhat interesting.
